# Comprehensive CPU Battle Test Plan

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a detailed test plan to verify CPU battle functionality at http://localhost:5174.

## Code Analysis Summary

The CPU battle system is implemented with the following key components:

1. **Entry Point**: Lobby.tsx - "ü§ñ „Åô„Åê„Å´ÂØæÊà¶" button (line 207)
2. **Handler**: App.tsx - `onStartDominionDirect` function (lines 238-242)
3. **Game Engine**: InteractiveTutorial.tsx with `isCPUMode=true` (line 128)
4. **CPU AI**: DominionEngine.ts with automated CPU turn execution (lines 692-873)

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Access and Navigation

1. **Open Application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5174`
   - **Expected**: Application loads with dark theme and lobby interface
   - **Verify**: No console errors, connection status shows "Êé•Á∂öÊ∏à„Åø" (connected)

2. **Lobby Interface Verification**
   - **Expected Elements**:
     - Header: "üé¥ „Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Ç≤„Éº„É†"
     - Six game mode cards including "CPUÂØæÊà¶"
     - CPU battle card has 2 buttons: "üé¥ „Ç´„Éº„ÉâÈÅ∏Êäû„Åó„Å¶ÂØæÊà¶" and "ü§ñ „Åô„Åê„Å´ÂØæÊà¶"
   - **Target Button**: "ü§ñ „Åô„Åê„Å´ÂØæÊà¶" (immediate battle button)

### Phase 2: CPU Battle Initiation

3. **Click "ü§ñ „Åô„Åê„Å´ÂØæÊà¶" Button**
   - **Expected Behavior**:
     - Console log: "ü§ñ „Åô„Åê„Å´ÂØæÊà¶ÈñãÂßã - „Ç´„Çπ„Çø„É†„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Å™„Åó"
     - App state changes to `currentView: 'dominion'`
     - Triggers InteractiveTutorial component with `isCPUMode: true`, `selectedCards: []`

4. **Game Initialization Screen**
   - **Expected Display**:
     - Title: "üéØ CPUÂØæÊà¶"
     - Description: "CPU„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„Å®1ÂØæ1„ÅßÂØæÊà¶„Åó„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ"
     - Debug info panel showing:
       - „É¢„Éº„Éâ: CPUÂØæÊà¶
       - ÈÅ∏Êäû„Ç´„Éº„ÉâÊï∞: 0 (Ê®ôÊ∫ñ„Éâ„Éü„Éã„Ç™„É≥)
       - „Ç≤„Éº„É†„Ç®„É≥„Ç∏„É≥: ‚úÖ OK
       - „Ç≤„Éº„É†Áä∂ÊÖã: ‚ùå Êú™ÂàùÊúüÂåñ
     - Loading indicator: "„Ç≤„Éº„É†ÂàùÊúüÂåñ‰∏≠..."

### Phase 3: Automatic Game Start

5. **Auto-Initialization Process**
   - **Expected Sequence**:
     - useEffect triggers `startGame()` after 100ms delay
     - DominionEngine.startGame() called with `['„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº', 'CPU']`
     - Game state initialized with standard Dominion cards
     - Success toast: "üéØ CPUÂØæÊà¶„ÅåÈñãÂßã„Åï„Çå„Åæ„Åó„ÅüÔºÅÔºàÊ®ôÊ∫ñ„Éâ„Éü„Éã„Ç™„É≥Ôºâ"

6. **Game Board Display**
   - **Expected Elements**:
     - Header: "üéØ CPUÂØæÊà¶" with turn counter
     - Player stats section with Human vs CPU statistics
     - Victory condition progress (Province count, empty supply piles)
     - Current player status (should be Human player's turn first)

### Phase 4: Game Flow Verification

7. **Human Player Turn (Action Phase)**
   - **Expected State**:
     - Phase indicator: "üéØ „Ç¢„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥"
     - Player resources: Actions=1, Buys=1, Coins=0
     - Hand: 5 cards (3 Estates, 7 Coppers initially)
     - Supply: All Dominion cards visible with correct counts
   - **Actions Available**:
     - Click action cards (if any)
     - "Ë≥ºÂÖ•„Å∏" button to move to buy phase

8. **Human Player Turn (Buy Phase)**
   - **Expected State**:
     - Phase indicator: "üí∞ Ë≥ºÂÖ•"
     - "üí∞ Ë≤°ÂÆù‰∏ÄÊã¨" button available
     - Supply cards show purchase eligibility (green border for affordable cards)
   - **Test Actions**:
     - Click "Ë≤°ÂÆù‰∏ÄÊã¨" to play all treasure cards
     - Verify coins increase appropriately
     - Click an affordable supply card to select it
     - Confirm purchase with "‚úÖ Ë≥ºÂÖ•" button

9. **Turn Transition to CPU**
   - **Expected Behavior**:
     - Click "„Çø„Éº„É≥ÁµÇ‰∫Ü" button
     - Cleanup phase executes (discard hand, draw 5 new cards)
     - Turn counter increases
     - CPU turn starts automatically

### Phase 5: CPU Behavior Verification

10. **CPU Turn Execution**

      - Automatic treasure card plays
      - Strategic purchases based on turn number
    - **CPU Strategy Verification**:
      - Early game: Buy Silver, Village, Woodcutter
      - Mid game: Buy Gold, Market, Laboratory, Smithy
      - Late game (turn 8+): Buy Victory cards (Province > Duchy > Estate)

11. **CPU Turn Completion**
    - **Expected Behavior**:
      - CPU completes all phases automatically
      - Turn returns to human player after ~1-2 seconds
      - Game log shows CPU actions
      - Supply counts updated based on CPU purchases

### Phase 6: Game Progression and End Conditions

12. **Multi-Turn Gameplay**
    - **Verify Multiple Cycles**:
      - Human and CPU alternate turns correctly
      - Turn counter increments properly
      - Victory point tracking updates
      - Supply depletion progresses realistically

13. **End Game Conditions**
    - **Test Scenarios**:
      - Province pile exhaustion (12 ‚Üí 0)
      - Three supply piles exhausted
      - End game modal displays correctly
      - Final scores calculated properly

### Phase 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases

14. **Error Scenarios**
    - **Test Invalid Actions**:
      - Clicking during CPU turn (should show error)
      - Trying to buy unaffordable cards
      - Playing cards in wrong phase
    - **Expected**: Appropriate error toasts, no game crashes

15. **Browser Console Monitoring**
    - **Watch For**:
      - No uncaught JavaScript errors

3. **Automated Verification (if available)**
   - Run any existing test suites
   - Check for test coverage of CPU battle scenarios

   - End game modal

2. **Console Logs**:
   - Game initialization logs
   - State transition logs
   - CPU decision logs
   - Any error messages

3. **Functionality Assessment**:

   - Specific issues encountered
   - Performance observations
   - User experience quality

4. **Final Verdict**:
   - Overall functionality rating
