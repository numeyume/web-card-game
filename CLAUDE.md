## Architecture Notes

### Game Flow
1. **Lobby** ‚Üí Create/join rooms via REST API + WebSocket
2. **Game Start** ‚Üí Matchmaker initializes game state  
3. **Game Loop** ‚Üí Socket events (playCard, buyCard, endTurn)
4. **Game End** ‚Üí Score calculation with creator bonuses
5. **Results** ‚Üí Match results with rankings

### Real-time Communication
- **REST API** for room management, card CRUD
- **WebSocket** for real-time game state synchronization
- **Authentication** via JWT with anonymous fallback

### Scoring Formula (4.4)
- **GameScore** = Victory Points √ó Base Multiplier
- **CreatorScore** = (Others' card usage √ó 10) + (Own usage √ó 5)  
- **TotalScore** = GameScore + CreatorScore

### Advanced Features
- **Card Usage Tracking**: Every card play/buy is recorded with player analytics
- **Voting System**: Post-game voting on cards with like/dislike and controversy detection
- **Player Analysis**: Automatic play style classification (Aggressive/Balanced/Creator/Explorer/Builder)
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live game stats and end condition monitoring
- **Community Features**: Global card popularity and cross-game insights

## Testing

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test
```

For load testing (when implemented):
```bash
# k6 load test for 100 concurrent players
k6 run --vus 100 --duration 30s loadtest.js
```
