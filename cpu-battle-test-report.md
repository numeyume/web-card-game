## Detailed Findings

### 1. Lobby Component (`/src/components/Lobby.tsx`)
**Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL**

- ✅ Contains "すぐに対戦" (immediate battle) button
- ✅ Button is properly labeled with 🤖 emoji
- ✅ `onStartDominionDirect` prop is correctly wired
- ✅ Button styling matches design system

**Code Verification:**
```typescript
<button 
  onClick={onStartDominionDirect}
  className="button-secondary w-full"
>
  🤖 すぐに対戦
</button>
```

### 2. App Component (`/src/App.tsx`)
**Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL**

- ✅ Proper state management with `currentView` 
- ✅ Direct CPU battle handler implemented
- ✅ Routes to InteractiveTutorial with `isCPUMode={true}`
- ✅ Bypasses WebSocket for CPU-only gameplay

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
onStartDominionDirect={() => {
  console.log('🤖 すぐに対戦開始 - カスタムカードなし')
  setSelectedCards([]) // 明示的に空の配列を設定
  setCurrentView('dominion')
}}
```

### 3. InteractiveTutorial Component
**Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL**

- ✅ CPU mode support via `isCPUMode` prop
- ✅ DominionEngine integration
- ✅ Auto-game initialization
- ✅ Proper player vs CPU setup
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Debug information panel

**Features Verified:**
- Automatic game start when `isCPUMode={true}`
- Player names: "プレイヤー" and "CPU"
- Standard Dominion card set when no custom cards
- Turn-based gameplay with CPU AI
- Real-time game state updates

### 4. DominionEngine (`/src/utils/DominionEngine.ts`)
**Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL**

- ✅ Complete Dominion game implementation
- ✅ Player initialization (human + CPU)
- ✅ Supply card setup (treasure, victory, action cards)
- ✅ Turn management and phase transitions
- ✅ CPU player detection (`isCurrentPlayerHuman()`)
- ✅ Game state management

## Expected User Flow

### Step 1: Lobby → CPU Battle
1. User opens `http://localhost:5173`
2. Page loads with lobby interface
3. User sees "CPU対戦" section with two buttons
4. User clicks "🤖 すぐに対戦" button

### Step 2: Game Initialization  
1. App transitions to `currentView='dominion'`
2. InteractiveTutorial loads with `isCPUMode={true}`
3. DominionEngine creates new game with 2 players
4. Game auto-starts within 100ms delay

### Step 3: Gameplay
1. Game board renders with full interface
2. Human player starts first (standard Dominion rules)
3. Player can play action cards, buy cards, end turn
4. CPU automatically makes moves when it's their turn
5. Game continues until end conditions are met

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Black Screen After Button Click
**Likelihood: LOW**
**Root Cause**: Component rendering failure
**Solution**: Check browser console for React errors

### Issue 2: Game Doesn't Initialize
**Likelihood: LOW** 
**Root Cause**: DominionEngine constructor failure
**Solution**: Verify game state callback function

### Issue 3: CPU Doesn't Make Moves
**Likelihood: MEDIUM**
**Root Cause**: CPU AI logic not implemented or broken
**Solution**: Check CPU player turn detection and move logic

### Issue 4: JavaScript Console Errors
**Likelihood: LOW**
**Root Cause**: TypeScript compilation or import issues
**Solution**: Check for module resolution problems

## Test Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Open Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Find CPU Battle**: Look for "CPU対戦" section in lobby
3. **Click Button**: Click "🤖 すぐに対戦"
4. **Monitor Console**: Watch for debug messages and errors
5. **Verify Game Start**: Confirm game initializes without black screen
6. **Test Gameplay**: Play a few turns to verify functionality
7. **Check CPU Moves**: Ensure CPU makes automatic moves

### Console Messages to Watch For
```
✅ Expected Messages:
- "🎯 App.tsx: CPU対戦モード開始 - CPUGameBoardをレンダリング中"
- "🎯 InteractiveTutorial - ゲーム開始試行"
- "🎯 DominionEngine.startGame呼び出し中..."
- "🎯 ゲーム状態設定完了"
- Toast: "🎯 CPU対戦が開始されました！（標準ドミニオン）"

❌ Error Messages to Watch For:
- Module import errors
- TypeScript compilation errors  
- React rendering errors
- Game state initialization failures
```
